# Ideas for the Paper
## Introduction
### 1. Overview of the Proposed Approach
Using a video encoded with the AV1 codec, we investigate how the motion vectors generated during video compression can be leveraged for computer vision tasks. Specifically, we explore whether these vectors can provide useful motion information for applications such as camera motion estimation, object tracking, and 3D scene reconstruction.

### 2. Motivation and Applications
The ability to reconstruct 3D geometry from video data has numerous applications, including:

* Robotics and autonomous navigation
* 3D modeling and digital asset creation
* Augmented and virtual reality systems
* Film production and visual effects
* Video game development
* Industrial inspection and measurement

Traditional approaches often require computationally expensive feature extraction and optical flow estimation. Motion information already available within compressed video streams may offer a more efficient alternative.

### 3. Why AV1?
AV1 is an open, royalty-free video codec designed for modern internet video delivery and is experiencing rapid industry adoption.

Several characteristics make AV1 attractive for this work:

* Wide and growing deployment across streaming platforms
* Open standard with accessible tooling and documentation
* Advanced motion compensation mechanisms
* Availability of motion vector information generated during encoding

While motion vectors are not unique to AV1, the codec provides a rich source of motion information that may be exploited for computer vision applications without requiring full optical flow computation.

### 4. Research Questions
* Can AV1 motion vectors serve as a useful approximation of scene motion?
* How do they compare to traditional optical flow methods?
* Can they provide sufficient information for Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pipelines?
* What are the limitations introduced by video compression?
